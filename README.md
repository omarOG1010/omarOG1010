### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings! My name is Omar, and I'm presently enrolled as a student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I possess a programming background, which dates back to my introduction to Robotics during my sixth-grade year. Presently, I am driven by ambitious goals and a relentless curiosity to delve into emerging technologies. I have attained proficiency in langauges and frameworks working in academia and industry. As I look ahead, my aspirations involve pursuing a formal education in Computer Science, more specifically Machine Learning.
